# academic-performance-prediction
Introduction

With the growing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in education, the ability to accurately predict student performance has become increasingly important for academic institutions and policymakers alike. This project aims to enhance academic performance prediction by developing a system capable of identifying patterns in student data. Such predictive models are essential not only for enabling early interventions and support planning but also for informing teaching strategies and curriculum design tailored to students' needs.

For instance, university admissions are essentially a prediction task — selecting candidates who are most likely to succeed academically. At many universities in Kazakhstan, including Nazarbayev University, admissions rely solely on standardized multiple-choice tests. While this offers objectivity, it fails to account for qualitative or contextual factors. A more nuanced, data-driven approach can complement existing practices by incorporating broader predictors without compromising fairness.

Academic performance is influenced by a wide variety of factors — parental education level, household income, access to resources, and prior academic achievements (Rodríguez-Hernández et al., 2020). Traditionally, however, machine learning models for grade prediction use only a narrow set of features, such as standardized test scores (Hsu & Schombert, 2010). This project takes a more comprehensive approach by integrating a diverse range of features, including socio-economic background, study habits, physical activity, and more, enabling a deeper understanding of the factors shaping student outcomes.

Goals
1) Assess how feature diversity affects model performance.
2) Compare narrow vs. broad feature sets across multiple predictive tasks.
3) Demonstrate how integrating secondary features can improve accuracy.
4) Explore the applicability of these models in real educational settings (e.g., for early intervention or admissions reform).

Conclusion
This project illustrates that:

1) Narrow feature sets (e.g., socio-economic data alone) are weak predictors of academic success.
2) Academic-performance-related features yield much better accuracy, especially for binary tasks.
3) Including broader student data (e.g., habits, family, lifestyle) meaningfully improves predictive power.
4) MLP models outperformed linear and tree-based models on diverse feature sets due to their ability to learn complex, nonlinear relationships.
